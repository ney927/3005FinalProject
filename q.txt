- ball_receipt -> outcome can be null
- 5050 -> outcome can be null
- basically all the booleans will be not null
- half_start should be late_video_start not late_video_end


Hi,

I was able to insert data into the project_database we created using psycopg2 on my&nbsp;

However, I am now trying to run the queries.py file in a virtual Linux environment to test my queries and running into two problems

I cannot find the option on pg4admin to manually change the password for user 'postgres'
Running the file produces the following error: connection failed: Connection refused
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?

I am confused as to why this is happening since I was able to connect to the database using the code we wrote. Any advice would be appreciated and let me know if you need more information. Sorry for the last minute Q&amp;A!
